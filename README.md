###Creation of my first API Rest using Mongo DB and Express for a educational purpose.

#### Request and Responses tested with Postman

#### noSQL DB - json object/document related

For this project, was created a instance of MongoDB at Mongo Atlas, a service hosted at the cloud
Also created a local host to get route access with localhost:3000

#### Framework mongoose for connection with MongoDB

#### Use of MVC to structure the data, manage HTTP functions and routes.

## Error Handling using Linter

### Use of Middleware

#### Functions that Intercept request to the API to handle the errors at first glance, before the controllers. (Controllers are also middlewares!)

Middlewares with classes with different kinds of errors (validation, requisition, base error)
